# Digital Image Processing
## About
This project contains programs allowing to perform selected elements of the digital image processing. 

## Setup
Create new conda environment from `environment.yml`
```bash
conda env create digital-image -f environment.yml
```

## Main
TODO

## Opening
This program performs binary on greyscale opening of the input image using linear structuring element.
- `opening.py` - morphology operations (dilation, erosion, opening)
- `element.py` - class with structuring element
- `plots.py` - function to plot results
- `utils.py` - functions to load and save an image

To run this program:
```bash
python opening\main.py
```
